# Neira_Sandra_HW-2_CRUSHING_BUGS

## TROUBLESHOOTING JAVASCRIPT
Research assignment

## Assignment Requirements:

Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) to fix two bugs that were discovered. 

1st bug: You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone this shouldnâ€™t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a time.

2nd bug:  problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed/reparented back to the drag zone, so the player has a fresh board to drop onto.

(Articulating the solution first will be a great help in completing the assignment successfully)
