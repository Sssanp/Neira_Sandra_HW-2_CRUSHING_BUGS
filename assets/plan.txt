Bug plan solution:

1st: be able to just drag & drop just one puzzle piece into the each drop zone

For achieve this this: 

handleDrop is responsible for handling the drop event when a puzzle piece is dropped into a drop zone. It prevents the default behaviour, checks if the drop zone already has a piece (children.length >= 1) and if not, adds the draggedPiece to the drop zone.

By adding e.preventDefault();:
 -Prevents the default behaviour of the drop event.

The condition if (this.children.length >= 1) { return; }:  
 -Checks if the drop zone already has a child element. In this case not adding a piece on top of another.

this.appendChild(draggedPiece);: 
 -If the drop zone is empty, append the draggedPiece to the current drop zone. Moves the puzzle piece from the drag zone to the drop zone.
