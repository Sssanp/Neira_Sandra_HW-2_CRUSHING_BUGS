Bug plan solution:

1st: be able to just drag & drop just one puzzle piece into the each drop zone

For achieve this this: 

handleDrop is responsible for handling the drop event when a puzzle piece is dropped into a drop zone. It prevents the default behaviour, checks if the drop zone already has a piece (children.length >= 1) and if not, adds the draggedPiece to the drop zone.

By adding e.preventDefault();:
 -Prevents the default behaviour of the drop event.

The condition if (this.children.length >= 1) { return; }:  
 -Checks if the drop zone already has a child element. In this case not adding a piece on top of another.

this.appendChild(draggedPiece);: 
 -If the drop zone is empty, append the draggedPiece to the current drop zone. Moves the puzzle piece from the drag zone to the drop zone.

 ----

 2nd: Reset working

Adding resetPuzzle function 
Repeats over each drop zone using dropZones.forEach. 
It checks if it has any children . 
If have a child removes it from the drop zone using dropZone.removeChild and stores it.

When the reset button is clicked, the resetPuzzle function will be called. It will remove the puzzle pieces from the drop.
resetButton variable is added to select the reset button element using its id. The resetButton.addEventListener is added for the click event on the reset button, which calls the resetPuzzle function.
